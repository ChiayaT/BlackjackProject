# BlackjackProject

## Description
The purpose of the Blackjack Project is to create a simulating app that allows the user to play a version of blackjack against the dealer. The app will allow the user to play multiple games of Blackjack until they choose to quit. Each game consists of both the user and the dealer receiving two cards. If the users card adds up to 21 right away, the user will win. If the user decides to continue to receive cards, they will continue receiving cards until they go over 21 or they choose to "Stand" or stop receiving cards. The dealers first card will not be shown until the user stops receiving cards. If the user manages to stay under 21, the dealer or computer will now be able to receive cards. The same process will occur for the dealer to recieve cards until the value of the hand reaches 17. 

## Technologies Used
The technologies used are the enum classes which were used to set final variables for classes.
Inheritance was used override methods from parent classes to child classes so that the parent classes may be used for other projects.
Git was used to push the project to gitHub
Switches were used to receive input to continue or stop 
An abstract class was used to develop a child class and may be used for further projects


## Lessons Learned
I learned that even if you use methods and many different classes that coding can still very well be repetitive. I found myself although trying not to repeat code, doing it either way. Although the different classes and methods did help, I still need to improve on my planning so that I do not need to repeat these mistakes. I often found myself going through my code to fix the repeated lines, I also found issues that occurred from poor planning of new methods.
